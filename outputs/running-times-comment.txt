The server running threads are slightly faster using the busy-wait method because it responds more quickly to events since it's always checking it whereas the semaphores would sleep the thread to allow another to be processed causing more delay inbetween. However, busy-waiting requires more system resource as more CPU cycles are wasted to keep checking availability.
